Migrating to the cloud is a significant undertaking. Done well, it can transform your business. Done poorly, it can lead to downtime, data loss, and budget overruns. Here's our checklist for a successful migration.

## Before You Start

### 1. Assess Your Current Infrastructure

Document everything you're running today:
- What applications and services are in use?
- What are the dependencies between systems?
- What data needs to be migrated?
- What are your current performance baselines?

### 2. Define Your Goals

Why are you moving to the cloud? Common motivations include:
- **Scalability** - Handle growth without buying hardware
- **Cost optimization** - Pay for what you use
- **Disaster recovery** - Better resilience and redundancy
- **Remote access** - Enable distributed teams

Your goals will shape your architecture decisions.

### 3. Choose Your Cloud Model

Not everything belongs in the public cloud. Consider:
- **Public cloud** (AWS, Azure, GCP) for scalable, variable workloads
- **Private cloud** for sensitive data and compliance requirements
- **Hybrid** for the best of both worlds

## Planning the Migration

### 4. Prioritize Workloads

Start with low-risk applications to build experience. Save mission-critical systems for later when your team is confident with the new environment.

### 5. Plan for Security

Cloud doesn't mean someone else handles security. You need:
- Identity and access management (IAM) policies
- Network security groups and firewalls
- Encryption for data at rest and in transit
- Monitoring and alerting

### 6. Budget Realistically

Cloud costs can surprise you. Account for:
- Compute and storage costs
- Data transfer fees (egress charges add up)
- Management and monitoring tools
- Training and potential consulting support

## During Migration

### 7. Test Thoroughly

Before cutting over:
- Validate data integrity after migration
- Test application functionality
- Verify performance meets requirements
- Confirm backup and recovery procedures work

### 8. Have a Rollback Plan

Things don't always go as planned. Know how you'll revert if critical issues arise.

## After Migration

### 9. Optimize Continuously

Cloud migration isn't a one-time event. Regularly review:
- Resource utilization (are you over-provisioned?)
- Cost allocation and optimization opportunities
- Security posture and compliance

### 10. Document Everything

Your future self will thank you. Document your architecture, configurations, and operational procedures.
