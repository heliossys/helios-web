Small and medium businesses are increasingly targeted by cyber attacks. Unfortunately, many don't realize their vulnerabilities until it's too late. Here are five common mistakes we see—and how to address them.

## 1. Default Credentials Everywhere

It's surprising how often we find routers, switches, and IoT devices still using factory default passwords. Attackers know these defaults and actively scan for them.

**Fix:** Audit every device on your network. Change all default credentials immediately. Use a password manager to generate and store strong, unique passwords.

## 2. No Network Segmentation

When everything is on one flat network, a breach anywhere means exposure everywhere. An infected laptop shouldn't be able to reach your accounting server.

**Fix:** Implement VLANs to separate different types of traffic. Guest WiFi should never touch your internal network. Critical systems should be isolated.

## 3. Outdated Firmware and Software

Unpatched systems are low-hanging fruit for attackers. Known vulnerabilities are actively exploited, sometimes within hours of disclosure.

**Fix:** Establish a regular patching schedule. Subscribe to security advisories for your critical systems. Consider automated patch management where appropriate.

## 4. No Monitoring or Logging

If you're not watching your network, you won't know when something's wrong. Many breaches go undetected for months.

**Fix:** Implement centralized logging. Set up alerts for suspicious activity. Even basic monitoring is better than none.

## 5. Relying Solely on Perimeter Security

A firewall alone isn't enough. Modern attacks often bypass perimeter defenses through phishing or compromised credentials.

**Fix:** Adopt a defense-in-depth approach. Combine perimeter security with endpoint protection, user training, and internal monitoring.
